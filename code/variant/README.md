# Variants

Here we explore:
- how `std::variant` offers an alternative to inheritance.

## Prerequisites

- slides about `std::variant`
- slides about lambda functions (for solution2)

## Instructions

In the file `variant.cpp`, replace inheritance with the use of a `std::variant`.
Two solutions are provided :
1. with `std::get_if`,
2. with `std::visit`.
