## Instructions

* Replace the C++98-style for loop with a range-based loop
* Replace the if / else statement with a conditional operator
* Replace the if / else statement with a switch statement
  * Note: You will need to change the signature of the "isodd" function to make this work. Have a look at the return type of the function. 
* Replace the for loop with a while loop - does it make sense?
* Replace the for loop with a do / while loop - does it make sense?
