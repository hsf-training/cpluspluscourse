# Functions and how arguments are passed in C++

Here, we will look a bit into how arguments are passed into functions.
You will find an example where everything is passed by value (by copy), but
there is a struct that's slow to copy.
We will try to work with it without copying it.

## Instructions
- Check out `functions.cpp`.
- Compile it (`make`) and run the program.
- Work on the tasks that you find in `functions.cpp`.
