This repository contains all material for the C++ Course taught at CERN from
Sebastien Ponce (LHCb).

## 📎 Getting the latest PDF

For each commit, the slides are compiled as a PDF and uploaded as "artifact".
The [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts)
explain how you can download the PDF.

## 🧰 Development setup

Make sure to install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pip3 install pre-commit
# cd to repository
pre-commit install
```

### Spell checking

Spell check is performed with the [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell)
pre-commit hook on every commit. To ignore words you can put them in the
`codespell.txt` file. This file should list the supposedly misspelled words with
one word per line and is case-sensitive.
