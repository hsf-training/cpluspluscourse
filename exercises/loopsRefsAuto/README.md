# Exercise about for loops, references and the `auto` keyword.

Here, we are playing with a struct that doesn't like to be copied. Imagine that this is some large data
that is expensive to copy. We will learn how to work with an array of such data without copying it.

## Instructions:
- Open `loopsRefsAuto.cpp`, and familiarise yourself with what happens in `main()`.
- Compile (`make`) and run the program.
- In the source file, you will find further tasks.
