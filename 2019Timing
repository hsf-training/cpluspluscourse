Day 1 :
  pause after 1:40 before static members in OO
  stopped at end of More C++ features (after move and copy elision)

  end of advanced OO, operators, templates (and exercise), STL, functors

Day 3 :
  repeated functors and templates quickly, finished advanced C++
  valgrind and cppcheck exercise (minus helgrind), python and concurrency (minus condition varaibles)
